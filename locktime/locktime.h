/// Implementation of the locked-time algorithm for synchronizing components
/// in a simulation to obtain deterministic logical dependencies.   In this
/// way, if every clients is individually determinisitic, the system as a
/// whole will be deterministic.
///
/// The system as a whole consists of a number of independent computation
// processes (processes, threads, event loops, whatever) abstractly called
/// "Clients" that share a common monotonic understanding of time, and which
/// may send and receive potentially information-bearing synchronization
/// points ("Messages").
///
/// When a client sends a message, it is assumed to depend on every message
/// previously received by that client.  In this way, the flow of messages
/// in the system is a directed acyclic graph, and correspondingly a partial
/// order on the messages.  "LockTime" is a scalar whose total order obeys the
/// partial order of messages.  Clients are allowed to depend on LockTime
/// with their own semantics; the server simply maintains relationships
/// between times.
///
/// This is accomplished by controlling when clients are permitted to receive
/// messages (and therefore to carry out computation that depends on those
/// messages).  This works if and only if clients obey some laws:
///
/// * Clients operate in a periodic polling mode of message receipt.
/// * No client may obtain a time signal from any source other than the locked
///   time server.
/// * No client may communicate with external components except via the
///   locked time mechanism.
///
/// To put it another way, a client's sent messages at a LockTime-announced
/// time t must be a function of its initial state, LockTime-received messages
/// prior to t, and t itself.
///
/// A typical client will periodically poll for new messages and
/// perform computation based on those messages.  
///
/// In the extreme case of all clients depending on all messages, this
/// algorithm is simply a gated event loop and no multiprocessing is permitted.
/// To enable multiprocessing, certain latency measures are introduced below.
